We have expanded the Discussion to touch on the concerns raised by this reviewer.
Specifically, we have mentioned possible links between the increased sulfonium
compounds in the eddy and DMS production, a hypothesis about the reason why
increased cyclonic biomass was not matched by increased export, and extensive
references to additional manuscripts with relevant data in lines 651-655 and 
689-718.


> Specific suggestions,
> Table 1, the format is not appropriate
Table 1 has been removed entirely.

> Figures 4, and 6 can be placed together.
While we agree that the data presented in Figures 4 and 6 can be placed side-by-side
for ease of comparison, we believe that keeping these figures in their separate
locations within the manuscript allows for better narrative flow (since the HEE
results are not discussed until several sections later) and graphical design (as
proper visualization of NMDS requires that the x- and y- axes share units).

This is an accurate assessment of the manuscript.

We have added the time of day as an explanatory factor to our analysis and reported the
new values from the PERMANOVA in the text (Lines 220-226, 262-266 and 505-509) and figures, 
as well as adding a supplemental
figure to visually represent some of the variance due to time of day. We do see 
diel differences at the surface and DCM during the eddy transect and these have been
reported, with the 175 meter differences more likely to be due to chance and very little
diel difference in the HEE samples at all. We have additionally added a supplemental
figure identifying a few select compounds for which diel effects are clearly visible
(trehalose and sucrose) alongside other highly abundant compounds which show no diel
effects.

We have double-checked that our normalization to internal standards removed any
analytical drift and can confirm that while significant drift occurred over
the course of the eddy transect sample run, the normalization removed this
effect and is not a major factor in the outliers visible in Fig. 2. (Lines 190-192)

> Blanks are mentioned but it is not shown how these were used for the data analysis.
We have added a note about how we used the methodological blanks to visually assess 
whether sample peak areas were above the background signal. (Lines 184-186)

> In line 142 the method for the evaluation of the matrix effect is mentioned, but no 
> results are given.
The Boysen et al. (2018) paper details the method for identifying the magnitude of the 
matrix effect by using a full-strength and water-diluted pooled sample and we believe 
that the reader is best suited to the detailed analysis presented there than a
brief review of it in this manuscript. We have confirmed that references to
this method are cited immediately after its mention here.

We have added additional text to this line to clarify the requested points of 
confusion. (Lines 133-138)

> Line 177: I would rather state “targeted analytical methods”. Metabolomics is by 
> definition rather untargeted.
While the exact definition of "targeted" vs "untargeted" metabolomics remains an 
active topic of debate, we believe that the methods used here are sufficiently
targeted (use of authentic standards and manual integration via Skyline/MSDIAL) to 
warrant the use of the term, especially in direct contrast to the automated/untargeted 
pipeline described immediately afterward and thus we have not made this change.

> How was this decided? Are the different response-factors in the MS considered?
As above, the Boysen et al. (2018) paper describes how internal standards are matched
to compounds for which no authentic standard was available based on the difference
in their response factor between a full-strength and half-strength pooled sample.
The only data presented quantitatively (i.e. as concentrations instead of relative
or absolute peak area) are those for which an authentic standard was available,
ensuring that each quantified compound's response factor was known. For untargeted
molecular features for which no authentic standard was available, data is only
discussed explicitly in peak area space or as a relative deviation between stations/
depths. We have also added links to the Github where the R code used to perform
these matching and normalization steps is available. (Lines 196-198 and 205-208)

We appreciate the reviewer's identification of this as an unhelpful distraction
from the main narrative and have removed chapter 4.1.1 entirely.

The CTD data has been added to the Supplemental Tables in 3 forms - first, containing
a list of all the stations and their locations with the number of bottles fired. Second,
with all the associated metadata compiled from Barone 2022. Finally, the values used
in the manuscript's analysis after interpolation to the locations in space and time
from which metabolite samples were collected.

> Software: Give the version number of the software used (e.g. Proteowizard, msConvert, 
> XCMS...)
Done. Software versions for Proteowizard, Skyline, MSDIAL, R, XCMS, and vegan have been
added to the manuscript. (Sections 3.6 and 3.7)

> Statistics: It would facilitate better interpretation if the statistical method used 
> for comparisons would be mentioned in the respective sections of results.
We have tried to add statistical methods used for comparisons in each section of the
results where applicable in this revision, largely annotating the places in which 
R-squared and p-values were obtained from PERMANOVAs. We have also added the sample
size to the Statistics section of the Results. (Lines 220-226)

> Line 239 Typo r = 0.697
We have switched to using a 0 in front of Pearson's correlation coefficient throughout
the manuscript to follow modern conventions.

It is unclear what the reviewer means by the selection of data points. We are aware that
the strong trend between particulate carbon and metabolite concentration is largely due
to the effect of depth and that was our inspiration for performing both the overall
regression and independent regressions at each depth.
