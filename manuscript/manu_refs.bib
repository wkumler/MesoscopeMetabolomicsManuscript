	abstract = {Abstract We examined the biogeochemical impact of paired mesoscale cyclones and anticyclones in spatial proximity (<200 km apart) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. While previous studies have demonstrated that upwelling associated with the intensification of cyclonic eddies can supply nutrients supporting plankton productivity, we observed that steeper vertical gradients in inorganic nutrients increased nutrient fluxes due to diapycnal mixing during the mature stage of cyclonic eddies. The increased diapycnal nutrient supply was linked with expansion of eukaryotic phytoplankton biomass and intensification of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. This perturbation in the plankton community was associated with increased fluxes of biominerals (specifically particulate inorganic carbon and particulate silica) and isotopically enriched organic nitrogen in particles exported in the cyclone. The time-integrated effects of thermocline vertical displacements on the lower euphotic zone were predictable deficits and surpluses of inorganic nutrients and dissolved oxygen, respectively. However, the stoichiometry of oxygen and inorganic nutrients differed from that predicted for production and consumption of phytoplankton biomass, requiring additional biological processes that decouple changes in oxygen and nutrient concentrations. The dynamics revealed by this study may be a common feature of oligotrophic ecosystems, where mesoscale biogeochemical perturbations are buffered by the DCM layer, which limits the ecological impact of eddies in the well-lit, near-surface ocean.},

We present simultaneous observations of bulk optical properties, including the particulate beam attenuation (cp) and backscattering (bbp) coefficients, and particle size distributions collected in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Clear and coherent diel cycles are observed in all bulk and size-fractionated optical proxies for particle biomass. We show evidence linking diurnal increases in cp and bbp to daytime particle growth and division of cells, with particles \&lt;7{\textmu}m driving the daily cycle of particle production and loss within the mixed layer. Flow cytometry data reveal the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Crocosphaera ($\sim$4{\textminus}7{\textmu}m) to be an important driver of cp at the time of sampling, whereas Prochlorococcus dynamics ($\sim$0.5{\textmu}m) were essential to reproducing temporal variability in bbp. This study is a step towards improved characterization of the particle size range represented by in situ bulk optical properties and a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive variability in particle production in the oligotrophic open ocean.},

	abstract = {Summary The physical and biological dynamics that influence phytoplankton communities in the oligotrophic ocean are complex, changing across broad temporal and spatial scales. Eukaryotic phytoplankton (e.g., diatoms), despite their relatively low abundance in oligotrophic waters, are responsible for a large component of the organic matter flux to the ocean interior. Mesoscale eddies can impact both microbial community structure and function, enhancing primary production and carbon export, but the mechanisms that underpin these dynamics are still poorly understood. Here, mesoscale eddy influences on the taxonomic diversity and expressed functional profiles of surface communities of microeukaryotes and particle-associated heterotrophic bacteria from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre were assessed over 2 years (spring 2016 and summer 2017). The taxonomic diversity of the microeukaryotes significantly differed by eddy polarity (cyclonic versus anticyclonic) and between sampling seasons/years and was significantly correlated with the taxonomic diversity of particle-associated heterotrophic bacteria. The expressed functional profile of these taxonomically distinct microeukaryotes varied consistently as a function of eddy polarity, with cyclones having a different expression pattern than anticyclones, and between sampling seasons/years. These data suggest that mesoscale forcing, and associated changes in biogeochemistry, could drive specific physiological responses in the resident microeukaryote community, independent of species composition.},

	abstract = "Sea surface height (SSH) is routinely measured from satellites and used to infer ocean currents, including eddies, that affect the distribution of organisms and substances in the ocean. SSH not only reflects the dynamics of the surface layer, but also is sensitive to the fluctuations
	of the main pycnocline; thus it is linked to events of nutrient upwelling. Beyond episodic upwelling events, it is not clear if and how SSH is linked to broader changes in the biogeochemical state of marine ecosystems. Our analysis of 23 years of satellite observations and biogeochemical measurements
	from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre shows that SSH is associated with numerous biogeochemical changes in distinct layers of the water column. From the sea surface to the depth of the chlorophyll maximum, dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen enigmatically increase with SSH, enhancing the abundance
	of heterotrophic picoplankton. At the deep chlorophyll maximum, increases in SSH are associated with decreases in vertical gradients of inorganic nutrients, decreases in the abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton, and increases in the abundance of prokaryotic phytoplankton. In waters below
	100 m depth, increases in SSH are associated with increases in organic matter and decreases in inorganic nutrients, consistent with predicted consequences of the vertical displacement of isopycnal layers. Our analysis highlights how satellite measurements of SSH can be used to infer the
	ecological and biogeochemical state of open-ocean ecosystems.",

	abstract = {Abstract Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},
