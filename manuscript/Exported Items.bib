  abstract = {Abstract                            Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for               ANOVA               (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's               F               -ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix.               P               -values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

  abstract = {Sea surface height (SSH) is routinely measured from satellites and used to infer ocean currents, including eddies, that affect the distribution of organisms and substances in the ocean. SSH not only reflects the dynamics of the surface layer, but also is sensitive to the fluctuations  of the main pycnocline; thus it is linked to events of nutrient upwelling. Beyond episodic upwelling events, it is not clear if and how SSH is linked to broader changes in the biogeochemical state of marine ecosystems. Our analysis of 23 years of satellite observations and biogeochemical measurements  from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre shows that SSH is associated with numerous biogeochemical changes in distinct layers of the water column. From the sea surface to the depth of the chlorophyll maximum, dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen enigmatically increase with SSH, enhancing the abundance  of heterotrophic picoplankton. At the deep chlorophyll maximum, increases in SSH are associated with decreases in vertical gradients of inorganic nutrients, decreases in the abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton, and increases in the abundance of prokaryotic phytoplankton. In waters below  {$\sim$}100 m depth, increases in SSH are associated with increases in organic matter and decreases in inorganic nutrients, consistent with predicted consequences of the vertical displacement of isopycnal layers. Our analysis highlights how satellite measurements of SSH can be used to infer the  ecological and biogeochemical state of open-ocean ecosystems.},

While previous studies have demonstrated that upwelling associated with the intensification of cyclonic eddies can supply nutrients supporting plankton productivity, we observed that steeper vertical gradients in inorganic nutrients increased nutrient fluxes due to diapycnal mixing during the mature stage of cyclonic eddies. The increased diapycnal nutrient supply was linked with expansion of eukaryotic phytoplankton biomass and intensification of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. This perturbation in the plankton community was associated with increased fluxes of biominerals (specifically particulate inorganic carbon and particulate silica) and isotopically enriched organic nitrogen in particles exported in the cyclone. The time-integrated effects of thermocline vertical displacements on the lower euphotic zone were predictable deficits and surpluses of inorganic nutrients and dissolved oxygen, respectively. However, the stoichiometry of oxygen and inorganic nutrients differed from that predicted for production and consumption of phytoplankton biomass, requiring additional biological processes that decouple changes in oxygen and nutrient concentrations. The dynamics revealed by this study may be a common feature of oligotrophic ecosystems, where mesoscale biogeochemical perturbations are buffered by the DCM layer, which limits the ecological impact of eddies in the well-lit, near-surface ocean.           ,              Key Points                                                                The steepness of the nutricline in mature mesoscale eddies is an important driver of variability in pelagic ecosystems                                                     Differences in eukaryotic phytoplankton communities alter the export of particulate inorganic carbon and particulate silica across eddies                                                     Relative changes in oxygen and nutrients linked to displacements of the thermocline reflect anomalous cycling of organic matter},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses --- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies cause deviations from the background physical and biogeochemical states of the oligotrophic oceans, but how these perturbations manifest in microbial ecosystem functioning, such as community macromolecular composition or carbon export, remains poorly characterized. We present comparative lipidomes from communities entrained in two eddies of opposite polarities (cyclone--anticyclone) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). A previous work on this two-eddy system has shown differences in particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) and biogenic silica sinking fluxes between the two eddies despite comparable total organic carbon fluxes. We measured the striking differences between the lipidomes of suspended and sinking particles that indicate taxon-specific responses to mesoscale perturbations. Specifically, cyanobacteria did not appear to respond to increased concentrations of phosphorus in the subsurface of the cyclonic eddy, while eukaryotic microbes exhibit P-stress relief as reflected in their lipid signatures. Furthermore, we found that two classes of lipids drive differences between suspended and sinking material: sinking particles are comparatively enriched in phosphatidylcholine (PC, a membrane-associated lipid) and triacylglycerol (TAG, an energy storage lipid). We observed significantly greater export of TAGs from the cyclonic eddy as compared to the anticyclone and found that this flux is strongly correlated with the concentration of ballast minerals (PIC and biogenic silica). This increased export of TAGs from the cyclone, but not the anticyclone, suggests that cyclonic eddy perturbations may be a mechanism for the delivery of energy-rich organic material below the euphotic zone.},

  abstract = {Fueled by light, phytoplankton produce the organic matter that supports ocean ecosystems and carbon sequestration. Ocean change impacts microbial metabolism with repercussions for biogeochemical cycling.           ,              ABSTRACT                            Light fuels photosynthesis and organic matter production by primary producers in the sunlit ocean. The quantity and quality of the organic matter produced influence community function, yet               in situ               measurements of metabolites, the products of cellular metabolism, over the diel cycle are lacking. We evaluated community-level biochemical consequences of oscillations of light in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre by quantifying 79 metabolites in particulate organic matter from 15 m every 4 h over 8 days. Total particulate metabolite concentration peaked at dusk and represented up to 2\% of total particulate organic carbon (POC). The concentrations of 55/79 (70\%) individual metabolites exhibited significant 24-h periodicity, with daily fold changes from 1.6 to 12.8, often greater than those of POC and flow cytometry-resolvable biomass, which ranged from 1.2 to 2.8. Paired metatranscriptome analysis revealed the taxa involved in production and consumption of a subset of metabolites. Primary metabolites involved in anabolism and redox maintenance had significant 24-h periodicity and diverse organisms exhibited diel periodicity in transcript abundance associated with these metabolites. Compounds with osmotic properties displayed the largest oscillations in concentration, implying rapid turnover and supporting prior evidence of functions beyond cell turgor maintenance. The large daily oscillation of trehalose paired with metatranscriptome and culture data showed that trehalose is produced by the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium               Crocosphaera               , likely to store energy for nighttime metabolism. Together, paired measurements of particulate metabolites and transcripts resolve strategies that microbes use to manage daily energy and redox oscillations and highlight dynamic metabolites with cryptic roles in marine microbial ecosystems.                                         IMPORTANCE               Fueled by light, phytoplankton produce the organic matter that supports ocean ecosystems and carbon sequestration. Ocean change impacts microbial metabolism with repercussions for biogeochemical cycling. As the small molecule products of cellular metabolism, metabolites often change rapidly in response to environmental conditions and form the basis of energy and nutrient management and storage within cells. By pairing measurements of metabolites and gene expression in the stratified surface ocean, we reveal strategies of microbial energy management over the day-night cycle and hypothesize that oscillating metabolites are important substrates for dark respiration by phytoplankton. These high-resolution diel measurements of               in situ               metabolite concentrations form the basis for future work into the specific roles these compounds play in marine microbial communities.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCM) are ubiquitous features in stratified oceanic systems. Their establishment and maintenance result from hydrographical stability favoring specific environmental conditions with respect to light and nutrient availability required for phytoplankton growth. This stability can potentially be challenged by mesoscale eddies impacting the water column's vertical structure and thus the environmental parameters that condition the subsistence of DCMs. Here, data from the global BGC-Argo float network are collocated with mesoscale eddies to explore their impact on DCMs. We show that cyclonic eddies, by providing optimal light and nutrient conditions, increase the occurrence of DCMs characterized by Deep Biomass Maxima for phytoplankton. In contrast, DCMs in anticyclonic eddies seem to be driven by photoacclimation as they coincide with Deep Acclimation Maxima without biomass accumulation. These findings suggest that the two types of eddies potentially have different impacts on the role of DCMs in global primary production.           ,              Plain Language Summary             In the global ocean, phytoplankton can be found at depths where their growth is limited by their access to light from the surface and nutrient supply from below. Depending on the combination of environmental conditions, phytoplankton at depth can either accumulate in densely populated layers or deploy adaptive survival strategies such as multiplying their internal light sensors. Given their dependence on environmental variations, phytoplankton can be affected by physical disturbances that alter the vertical structure of the water column's properties. Among these are mesoscale eddies, large water structures dominated by rotation on the horizontal plane which also induce vertical physical movements. In this study, we associate data from autonomous robots that drift with ocean currents and sample physical and biological properties down to a depth of 2,000~meters, with mesoscale eddies detected by satellite. We show that on a global scale, cold mesoscale eddies promote the growth of phytoplankton at depth.           ,              Key Points                                                                Deep Chlorophyll Maxima are key biological features of stratified environments that escape satellite ocean-color detection                                                     The impact of mesoscale eddies on DCM is assessed by matching a global BGC-Argo database with eddies detected from satellite altimetry                                                     While cyclonic eddies increase biomass maxima occurrences, anticyclonic eddies favor the presence of maxima resulting from photoacclimation},

Sea-ice diatoms have a number of adaptations, including accumulation of compatible solutes, that allows them to inhabit this highly variable environment characterized by extremes in temperature, salinity, and light. In addition to protecting them from extreme conditions, these compounds present a labile, nutrient-rich source of organic matter, and include precursors to climate active compounds (e.g., dimethyl sulfide [DMS]), which are likely regulated with environmental change. Here, intracellular concentrations of 45 metabolites were quantified in three sea-ice diatom species and were compared to two temperate diatom species, with a focus on compatible solutes and free amino acid pools. There was a large diversity of metabolite concentrations between diatoms with no clear pattern identifiable for sea-ice species. Concentrations of some compatible solutes (isethionic acid, homarine) approached 1\,M in the sea-ice diatoms, Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Navicula cf. perminuta, but not in the larger sea-ice diatom, Nitzschia lecointei or in the temperate diatom species. The differential use of compatible solutes in sea-ice diatoms suggests different adaptive strategies and highlights which small organic compounds may be important in polar biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, the daily pulse of photosynthetic carbon (C) fixation is closely balanced by losses. This concert of growth and loss is driven by a diverse assemblage of plankton, including the diazotroph               Crocosphaera               sp. While primary production is relatively well characterized in this ecosystem, the extent of C transfer to secondary producers is poorly constrained. Here, we use automated imaging flow cytometry and population modeling to study the coupling of C production by               Crocosphaera               and subsequent grazing by nanoplanktonic protists.               Crocosphaera               cells represent on average 30\% of the nanoplankton detected by the Imaging FlowCytoBot in the surface layer of mesoscale eddies during summertime. The size spectra show a maximum in the frequency of               Crocosphaera               doublet cells just prior to mitotic division at midday, with an average estimated growth rate of 0.8\,{\textpm}\,0.5 d               -1               . We also identified potential predators by fitting a Lotka--Volterra model to plankton time series observations. Significant predators include the dinoflagellates               Protoperidinium               and               Dinophysis               as well as the ciliate               Strombidium               , which were all imaged with               Crocosphaera               in food vacuoles. The estimated C demand of the main grazers fluctuated between 25\% and 250\% of               Crocosphaera               new production in an anticyclonic eddy where we observed the onset of a               Crocosphaera               -driven bloom. Heterotrophic               Protoperidinium               drove most of the estimated C demand, with grazing rates nearly equivalent to               Crocosphaera               growth rates (0.6\,{\textpm}\,0.4 d               -1               on average), but saturating at high prey concentrations. Our novel results demonstrate tight coupling between specific protistan predators and a diazotrophic prey.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Mesoscale eddies have been shown to support elevated dinitrogen (N               2               ) fixation rates (NFRs) and abundances of N               2               -fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs), but the mechanisms underlying these observations are not well understood. We sampled two pairs of mesoscale cyclones and anticyclones in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre in 2017 and 2018 and compared our observations with seasonal patterns from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program. Consistent with previous reports, we found that NFRs were anomalously high for this region (up to 3.7-fold above previous monthly HOT observations) in the centers of both sampled anticyclones. In 2017, these elevated rates coincided with high concentrations of the diazotroph               Crocosphaera               . We then coupled our field-based observations, together with transcriptomic analyses of nutrient stress marker genes and ecological models, to evaluate the role of biological (via estimates of growth and grazing rates) and physical controls on populations of               Crocosphaera               ,               Trichodesmium               , and diatom symbionts at the mesoscale. Our results suggest that increased               Crocosphaera               abundances in the 2017 anticyclone resulted from the alleviation of phosphate limitation, allowing cells to grow at rates exceeding grazing losses. In contrast, distributions of larger, buoyant taxa (               Trichodesmium               and diatom symbionts) appeared less affected by eddy-driven biological controls. Instead, they appeared driven by physical dynamics along frontal boundaries that separate cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. No examined controls were able to explain our 2018 findings of higher NFRs in the anticyclone. A generalized explanation of elevated NFRs in mesoscale eddies remains challenging due to the interplay of eddy-driven bottom-up, top-down, and physical control mechanisms.                        ,              Key Points                                                                Nitrogen fixation rates in the centers of two anticyclonic eddies were anomalously high compared to historical Hawaii Ocean Time-series data                                                                          High                     Crocosphaera                     abundance in one anticyclonic eddy was linked to both reduced phosphate limitation and reduced losses due to grazing                                                                        Eddies affect specific diazotroph taxa through the physical accumulation of cells and through differential bottom-up and top-down forcing},

Yet, specific factors that determine community composition and metabolic activity are difficult to resolve in complex microbial populations, complicating predictions of microbial processes in a changing ocean. Microbial metabolism generates small organic molecules that reflect both the biochemical and physiological diversity as well as the taxonomic specificity of these biological processes. These small molecules serve as the conduit for taxon-specific signaling and exchange. Here, we use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics to taxonomically categorize 111 metabolites that include small molecules in central and secondary metabolism across 42 taxa representing numerically dominant and metabolically important lineages of microbial autotrophs and heterotrophs. Patterns in metabolite presence-absence broadly reflected taxonomic lineages. A subset of metabolites that includes osmolytes, sulfur-containing metabolites, sugars, and amino acid derivatives provided chemotaxonomic information among phytoplankton taxa. A variety of phytohormones and signaling molecules were predominantly found in the heterotrophic bacteria and archaea, expanding knowledge of metabolites implicated in modulating interactions between microbes. This chemotaxonomic inventory of marine microbial metabolites is a key step in deciphering metabolic networks that influence ocean biogeochemical cycles.},

We examined spatial variations in upper ocean (0--100\,m) nutrient inventories, N2 fixing microorganism diversity and abundance, and rates of N2 fixation in an anticyclonic eddy near Station ALOHA (22{$^\circ$} 45{$\prime$} N, 158{$^\circ$} 00{$\prime$} W) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). In July 2005, satellite-based sea surface altimetry and ocean color observation revealed an anticyclonic eddy with enhanced chlorophyll in the upper ocean in the vicinity of Station ALOHA. Within the eddy, near-surface ocean chlorophyll concentrations were {$\sim$}5-fold greater than in the surrounding waters. Inventories of nitrate and phosphate in the eddy were similar to the concentrations historically observed at Station ALOHA, while silicic acid inventories were significantly depleted (one-way analysis of variance, P\&lt;0.01). Quantitative PCR determinations of nifH gene copies revealed relatively high abundances of several N2 fixing cyanobacteria, including Trichodesmium spp., Crocosphaera watsonii and Richelia intracellularis. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) amplified nitrogenase (nifH) gene transcripts were cloned and sequenced to examine the diversity of active N2 fixing microorganisms; these clone libraries were dominated by sequence-types 97\%--99\% identical to the filamentous cyanobacteria Trichodesmium spp. Near-surface ocean rates of N2 fixation were 2--18 times greater (averaging 8.6{\textpm}5.6\,nmol N per l per day) than previously reported measurements at Station ALOHA. These results suggest that mesoscale physical variability can play an important role in modifying the abundances of N2 fixing microorganisms and associated rates of N2 fixation in open ocean ecosystems.},

Physiochemical changes in the environment, such as those that result from mesoscale eddies, may impact protistan communities, but the effects that such changes have on protists are poorly known. A metatranscriptomic study was conducted to investigate how eddies affected protists at adjacent cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy sites in the oligotrophic ocean at four depths from 25 to 250\,m. Eddy polarity impacted protists at all depths sampled, although the effects of eddy polarity were secondary to the impact of depth across the depth range. Eddy-induced vertical shifts in the water column yielded differences in the cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy protistan communities, and these differences were the most pronounced at and just below the deep chlorophyll maximum. An analysis of transcripts associated with protistan nutritional physiology at 150\,m revealed that cyclonic eddies may support a more heterotrophic community, while anticyclonic eddies promote a more phototrophic community. The results of this study indicate that eddies alter the metabolism of protists particularly in the lower euphotic zone and may therefore impact carbon export from the euphotic zone.},

Eukaryotic phytoplankton (e.g., diatoms), despite their relatively low abundance in oligotrophic waters, are responsible for a large component of the organic matter flux to the ocean interior. Mesoscale eddies can impact both microbial community structure and function, enhancing primary production and carbon export, but the mechanisms that underpin these dynamics are still poorly understood. Here, mesoscale eddy influences on the taxonomic diversity and expressed functional profiles of surface communities of microeukaryotes and particle-associated heterotrophic bacteria from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre were assessed over 2\,years (spring 2016 and summer 2017). The taxonomic diversity of the microeukaryotes significantly differed by eddy polarity (cyclonic versus anticyclonic) and between sampling seasons/years and was significantly correlated with the taxonomic diversity of particle-associated heterotrophic bacteria. The expressed functional profile of these taxonomically distinct microeukaryotes varied consistently as a function of eddy polarity, with cyclones having a different expression pattern than anticyclones, and between sampling seasons/years. These data suggest that mesoscale forcing, and associated changes in biogeochemistry, could drive specific physiological responses in the resident microeukaryote community, independent of species composition.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In stratified oligotrophic waters, phytoplankton communities forming the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) are isolated from atmospheric iron sources above and remineralized iron sources below. Reduced supply leads to a minimum in dissolved iron (dFe) near 100~m, but it is unclear if iron limits growth at the DCM. Here, we propose that natural iron addition events occur regularly with the passage of mesoscale eddies, which alter the supply of dFe and other nutrients relative to the availability of light, and can be used to test for iron limitation at the DCM. This framework is applied to two eddies sampled in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Observations in an anticyclonic eddy center indicated downwelling of iron-rich surface waters, leading to increased dFe at the DCM but no increase in productivity. In contrast, uplift of isopycnals within a cyclonic eddy center increased supply of both nitrate and dFe to the DCM, and led to dominance of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton. Iron addition experiments did not increase productivity in either eddy, but significant enhancement of leucine incorporation in the light was observed in the cyclonic eddy, a potential indicator of iron stress among               Prochlorococcus               . Rapid cycling of siderophores and low dFe:nitrate uptake ratios also indicate that a portion of the microbial community was stressed by low iron. However, near-complete nitrate drawdown in this eddy, which represents an extreme case in nutrient supply compared to nearby Hawaii Ocean Time-series observations, suggests that recycling of dFe in oligotrophic ecosystems is sufficient to avoid iron limitation in the DCM under typical conditions.                        ,              Key Points                                                                Both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies add iron to the lower euphotic zone of oligotrophic gyres                                                     In an anticyclonic eddy, dissolved iron at the deep chlorophyll maximum increased but productivity did not                                                     Uptake of upwelled iron and nitrate in a cyclonic eddy led to low iron conditions and stress, but did not limit productivity},

The structure of each chemical is critical to its biological and ecosystem function, yet the diversity of biomolecules produced by marine microbial communities remained mainly unexplored, especially small polar molecules which are often considered the currency of the microbial loop.           ,              ABSTRACT                            Phytoplankton transform inorganic carbon into thousands of biomolecules that represent an important pool of fixed carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in the surface ocean. Metabolite production differs between phytoplankton, and the flux of these molecules through the microbial food web depends on compound-specific bioavailability to members of a wider microbial community. Yet relatively little is known about the diversity or concentration of metabolites within marine plankton. Here, we compare 313 polar metabolites in 21 cultured phytoplankton species and in natural planktonic communities across environmental gradients to show that bulk community metabolomes reflect the chemical composition of the phytoplankton community. We also show that groups of compounds have similar patterns across space and taxonomy, suggesting that the concentrations of these compounds in the environment are controlled by similar sources and sinks. We quantify several compounds in the surface ocean that represent substantial understudied pools of labile carbon. For example, the N-containing metabolite homarine was up to 3\% of particulate carbon and is produced in high concentrations by cultured               Synechococcus               , and S-containing gonyol accumulated up to 2.5\,nM in surface particles and likely originates from dinoflagellates or haptophytes. Our results show that phytoplankton composition directly shapes the carbon composition of the surface ocean. Our findings suggest that in order to access these pools of bioavailable carbon, the wider microbial community must be adapted to phytoplankton community composition.                                         IMPORTANCE               Microscopic phytoplankton transform 100 million tons of inorganic carbon into thousands of different organic compounds each day. The structure of each chemical is critical to its biological and ecosystem function, yet the diversity of biomolecules produced by marine microbial communities remained mainly unexplored, especially small polar molecules which are often considered the currency of the microbial loop. Here, we explore the abundance and diversity of small biomolecules in planktonic communities across ecological gradients in the North Pacific and within 21 cultured phytoplankton species. Our work demonstrates that phytoplankton diversity is an important determinant of the chemical composition of the highly bioavailable pool of organic carbon in the ocean, and we highlight understudied yet abundant compounds in both the environment and cultured organisms. These findings add to understanding of how the chemical makeup of phytoplankton shapes marine microbial communities where the ability to sense and use biomolecules depends on the chemical structure.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Chromatographic peakpicking continues to represent a significant bottleneck in automated LC--MS workflows. Uncontrolled false discovery rates and the lack of manually-calibrated quality metrics require researchers to visually evaluate individual peaks, requiring large amounts of time and breaking replicability. This problem is exacerbated in noisy environmental datasets and for novel separation methods such as hydrophilic interaction columns in metabolomics, creating a demand for a simple, intuitive, and robust metric of peak quality.                                         Results               Here, we manually labeled four HILIC oceanographic particulate metabolite datasets to assess the performance of individual peak quality metrics. We used these datasets to construct a predictive model calibrated to the likelihood that visual inspection by an MS expert would include a given mass feature in the downstream analysis. We implemented two novel peak quality metrics, a custom signal-to-noise metric and a test of similarity to a bell curve, both calculated from the raw data in the extracted ion chromatogram, and found that these outperformed existing measurements of peak quality. A simple logistic regression model built on two metrics reduced the fraction of false positives in the analysis from 70--80\% down to 1--5\% and showed minimal overfitting when applied to novel datasets. We then explored the implications of this quality thresholding on the conclusions obtained by the downstream analysis and found that while only 10\% of the variance in the dataset could be explained by depth in the default output from the peakpicker, approximately 40\% of the variance was explained when restricted to high-quality peaks alone.                                         Conclusions               We conclude that the poor performance of peakpicking algorithms significantly reduces the power of both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses to detect environmental differences. We demonstrate that simple models built on intuitive metrics and derived from the raw data are more robust and can outperform more complex models when applied to new data. Finally, we show that in properly curated datasets, depth is a major driver of variability in the marine microbial metabolome and identify several interesting metabolite trends for future investigation.},

These blooms are sustained by eddy/wind interactions, which amplify the eddy-induced upwelling. In contrast, eddy/wind interactions dampen eddy-induced upwelling in cyclones.

  abstract = {Significance                            Vast areas of the oceans are N limited, and how microalgae can flourish in these N-poor waters is still not known. Furthermore, mechanisms and sites of N uptake and storage have not been fully determined. We show that crystalline guanine (C               5               H               5               N               5               O) is an important N storage form for phytoplankton and for symbiotic dinoflagellates of corals. The widespread occurrence of guanine reserves among taxonomically distant microalgal species suggests an early evolutionary origin of its function as N storage. Crystalline guanine appears to be a multifunctional biochemical with an important role in the N cycle that remains to be elucidated. In particular, a better knowledge of N-storage metabolism is necessary to understand the impact of eutrophication on coral-symbiont interaction.                        ,                             Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient for microalgae, influencing their productivity, composition, and growth dynamics. Despite the dramatic consequences of N starvation, many free-living and endosymbiotic microalgae thrive in N-poor and N-fluctuating environments, giving rise to questions about the existence and nature of their long-term N reserves. Our understanding of these processes requires a unequivocal identification of the N reserves in microalgal cells as well as their turnover kinetics and subcellular localization. Herein, we identified crystalline guanine as the enigmatic large-capacity and rapid-turnover N reserve of microalgae. The identification was unambiguously supported by confocal Raman, fluorescence, and analytical transmission electron microscopies as well as stable isotope labeling. We discovered that the storing capacity for crystalline guanine by the marine dinoflagellate               Amphidinium               carterae               was sufficient to support N requirements for several new generations. We determined that N reserves were rapidly accumulated from guanine available in the environment as well as biosynthesized from various N-containing nutrients. Storage of exogenic N in the form of crystalline guanine was found broadly distributed across taxonomically distant groups of microalgae from diverse habitats, from freshwater and marine free-living forms to endosymbiotic microalgae of reef-building corals (               Acropora millepora               ,               Euphyllia paraancora               ). We propose that crystalline guanine is the elusive N depot that mitigates the negative consequences of episodic N shortage. Guanine (C               5               H               5               N               5               O) may act similarly to cyanophycin (C               10               H               19               N               5               O               5               ) granules in cyanobacteria. Considering the phytoplankton nitrogen pool size and dynamics, guanine is proposed to be an important storage form participating in the global N cycle.},

In fall 2010, local maxima in abundance were observed in cyclones. We hypothesized surface Ekman transport convergence as a mechanism for trapping buoyant colonies in cyclones. Idealized models supported the potential of this process to influence the distribution of buoyant colonies over time scales of several months. In spring 2011, the highest vertically integrated colony abundances were observed in anticyclones. These peaks in abundance correlated with anomalously fresh water, suggesting riverine input as a driver of the relationship.

Marine organisms must accumulate compatible solutes in their cells, counteracting the high exterior osmotic pressure. However,               Trichodesmium               does not possess any known genes for the synthesis of compatible solutes, making its proliferation in the high-salinity environment enigmatic. We demonstrate that               Trichodesmium               cultures in the laboratory as well as natural populations in the ocean synthesize homoserine betaine, previously unknown as a compatible solute, and elucidated the biosynthetic pathway. The high intracellular concentrations will lead to a major injection of this organic compound into the oligotrophic ocean, when natural               Trichodesmium               blooms lyse. Such sudden releases of homoserine betaine could impact the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen.                        ,                             The oceanic N               2               -fixing cyanobacterium               Trichodesmium               spp. form extensive surface blooms and contribute significantly to marine carbon and nitrogen cycles in the oligotrophic subtropical and tropical oceans.               Trichodesmium               grows in salinities from 27 to 43 parts per thousand (ppt), yet its salt acclimation strategy remains enigmatic because the genome of               Trichodesmium erythraeum               strain IMS101 lacks all genes for the biosynthesis of any known compatible solute. Using NMR and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy, we identified the main compatible solute in               T. erythraeum               strain IMS101 as the quaternary ammonium compound               N               ,               N               ,               N               -trimethyl homoserine (or homoserine betaine) and elucidated its biosynthetic pathway.

We quantified the frequency and intensity of disturbances that altered upper ocean light and nutrients in the context of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series program climatology, and evaluated picoeukaryotic community resilience based on shifts in dissimilarity in community structure at different depths in the euphotic zone. Our results suggest that in this stratified habitat, picoeukaryote communities are resilient on timescales of days to weeks in response to these physical disturbances, and that the juxtaposition of mesoscale and submesoscale disturbances on more predictable seasonality requires spatially and temporally resolved assessment of community response and resilience. We highlight the value of examining recent (days to weeks) physical forcing of the upper ocean for insight into the influences of physical habitat alterations that structure the contemporaneous plankton community.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Small, biologically produced, organic molecules called metabolites play key roles in microbial systems where they directly mediate exchanges of nutrients, energy, and information. However, the study of dissolved polar metabolites in seawater and other environmental matrices has been hampered by analytical challenges including high inorganic ion concentrations, low analyte concentrations, and high chemical diversity. Here we show that a cation-exchange solid-phase extraction (CX-SPE) sample preparation approach separates positively charged and zwitterionic metabolites from seawater and freshwater samples, allowing their analysis by liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry. We successfully extracted 69 known compounds from an in-house compound collection and evaluated the performance of the method by establishing extraction efficiencies (EEs) and limits of detection (pM to low nM range) for these compounds. CX-SPE extracted a range of compounds including amino acids and compatible solutes, resulted in very low matrix effects, and performed robustly across large variations in salinity and dissolved organic matter concentration. We compared CX-SPE to an established SPE procedure (PPL-SPE) and demonstrate that these two methods extract fundamentally different fractions of the dissolved metabolite pool with CX-SPE extracting compounds that are on average smaller and more polar. We use CX-SPE to analyze four environmental samples from distinct aquatic biomes, producing some of the first CX-SPE dissolved metabolomes. Quantified compounds ranged in concentration from 0.0093 to 49\,nM and were composed primarily of amino acids (0.15--16\,nM) and compatible solutes such as trimethylamine N-oxide (0.89--49\,nM) and glycine betaine (2.8--5.2~nM).},
