# MESOSCOPE Metabolomics Manuscript

This repository contains code and figures associated with the manuscript discussing the influence of mesoscale eddies on the marine microbial metabolome as well as various associated metadata.

## Abstract
Mesoscale eddies significantly alter open ocean environments such as the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Previous studies have explored eddy effects on biogeochemical measurements and community composition but not on the molecular composition of particulate organic matter. This study reports the exact concentration of 67 metabolites and relative abundances for 640 molecular features to understand how mesoscale eddies impact the NPSGâ€™s metabolome during two cruises in 2017 and 2018. We find that many metabolites track biomass trends, but biosignals like isethionic acid, homarine, and trigonelline linked to picoeukaryotes were enriched at the deep chlorophyll maximum of the cyclonic features, while degradation products such as arsenobetaine were enriched in anticyclones. Additionally, we identify taurine betaine (N,N,N-trimethyltaurine) in open ocean samples for the first time. By analyzing depth variability (accounting for 20-40% of metabolomic variability across ~150 meters) and isopycnal disruption (explaining 10-20% of variability across a sea level anomaly range of 40 centimeters), this analysis constrains the importance of mesoscale eddies in modeling the chemical composition of particulate matter in the largest biomes on the planet.
